## v1.5.5 — 2026-04-05

### Firmware

- **Confidence scoring**: new `DR_CONF` (0–100) from 8 weighted detection signals — SNR anomalies, pseudorange residuals, SNR temporal correlation, heading reversals, GDOP changes, GPS time drift, velocity-position mismatch, clock bias jump. Score adapts automatically when signals are unavailable (e.g. UM980 uses ~5 of 8).
- **Heading reversal detection**: triggers DR1 on sudden course flip inconsistent with IMU.
- **GPS time anomaly detection**: triggers DR1 when GPS time jumps unexpectedly.
- **Geo-fence** (`FENCE_RAD`): triggers DR1 if position drifts beyond a radius from the first fix (default 600 km, max 2000 km). Catches slow-drift spoofing.
- **South-hemisphere hard block**: instant DR1 when latitude goes below 0. Now configurable via `HEMI_EN` parameter.
- **Clock bias jump detection** (u-blox only): uses NAV-CLOCK to detect receiver clock manipulation.
- **Velocity-position mismatch** (u-blox only): cross-checks reported velocity against position delta.
- **DR1 max duration** (`DR1_MAX_MS`): forces exit from DR1 after a configurable timeout. Useful for long-range missions.
- **USB-C firmware updates**: connect USB-C cable, press RESET — no extra hardware needed after initial flash.
- **USB-C log download**: spoofing logs can be downloaded over USB-C directly.
- **App boot fix**: corrected application vector table at 0x0800C000.
- **RDP1 re-enabled**: readout protection restored after v1.5.4 debugging.

### Server / Tools

- **SpoofEvent v2**: richer event format with confidence score and trigger breakdown.
- **KML/GPX export**: download spoofing events as KML (Google Earth) or GPX from the cloud dashboard.
- **Fleet anomaly detection**: dashboard flags unusual patterns across multiple boards.
- **Provisioning tool**: USB-C auto-detect mode — select "(USB-C auto-detect)" as port.

### Docs

- Added confidence score documentation with signal weight table.
- Added u-blox vs UM980 feature coverage table.
- Documented new DR1 triggers (heading, time, geo-fence, clock bias, velocity-position).
- Added `DR1_MAX_MS`, `FENCE_RAD`, `HEMI_EN` to tuning manual.

## v1.5.4 — 2026-04-04

### Firmware

- **Critical fix**: compiler constant-folded key sentinel checks, causing provisioning validation to always pass. Fixed with volatile barriers.
- **PLL init reorder**: moved PLL clock init before app validation for faster boot.
- **Detailed error codes**: added BEGIN BAD_METADATA diagnostic codes for easier debugging.

## v1.5.3 — 2026-04-04

### Firmware

- **Anti-clone UID binding**: firmware is now cryptographically locked to each board's unique hardware ID. Copying firmware to another board renders it non-functional.
- **Security hardening**: additional integrity checks in bootloader.

### Server / Tools

- **Landing page and docs site**: launched gps.airdroper.org with full documentation.
- **Desktop app (.exe)**: AirDroper GNSS Filter provisioning tool with GUI.
- **Docs version selector**: browse documentation for specific firmware versions.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-04-03

### Firmware

- **SpoofAnalytics event logging**: spoofing events are stored in on-board flash with timestamp, position, trigger reason, satellite count, and SNR data.
- **Log download**: events can be uploaded to the cloud dashboard via USB-UART or USB-C.

### Server

- **Cloud dashboard** (gps.airdroper.org/dashboard): web interface for viewing spoofing events, flight tracks, and board status.
- **EW interference map** (gps.airdroper.org/ew-map): live global GNSS interference map with ADS-B, marine AIS, air raid alerts, 61 known EW zones, crowdsourced reports, route risk assessment, Telegram alerts, and predictive model.
- **License server**: automated provisioning and firmware distribution.
- **Server hardening**: rate limiting, input validation, HTTPS enforcement.
